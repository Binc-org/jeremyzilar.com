I'm on the board of the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/). Recently, I've been helping the _Rail_ produce a series of daily conversations with artists, writers, filmmakers, and poets from around the world called "_[The New Social Environment](https://brooklynrail.org/events)_", where we explore the role that artists and arts organizations play in shaping our society.

Recently, I was a strategist at 18F and Director of [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/) a program aimed at helping governments design and build better, more accessible digital services for the public where I oversaw the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and 22 communities of practice. Before joining government, I was a design strategist at _The New York Times_, where I designed and built the company's first blogging platform and launched over 200 blogs.
