## Let's find a way to connect:

- **Email** — [jeremyzilar@gmail.com](mailto:jeremyzilar@gmail.com)
- **In-person meetings** — I prefer to meet in Manhattan, near the West Village or the World Trade Center building. [Find a time »](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/in-person)
- **Online meetings** — I generally use [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/), or [WhereBy](https://whereby.com/), but am open to using other services. [Find a time »](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/online)
- **Phone** — Sometimes the phone is the easiest. I am happy to provide my number after you schedule a time to meet. [Find a time »](https://calendly.com/jeremyzilar/online)

If this is our first time talking, it would be helpful for me to know more about:
- your team composition (size, skills, location, etc..)
- what role you play on the team
- some of the top problems you'd like to solve
- current goals or objectives
